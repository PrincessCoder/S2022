<h2>Allée Allouez</h2>

<p>The concept is to support sustainability by encouraging alternate transportation while supporting local businesses in the Village of Allouez, WI.</p>
<p><strong>Geography</strong><br/>
    Allouez is located between Green Bay to the north, and De Pere to the south. The Fox River forms a natural border to the west and the East River to the east. According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 5.15 square miles (13.34 km2), of which, 4.61 square miles (11.94 km2) of it is land and 0.54 square miles (1.40 km2) is water.[7]</p>
<p>In response to critique feedback, I researched alternate words to "walk." Thank you for the comments, I'm always trying to make my work more inclusive.<br/><br/>
